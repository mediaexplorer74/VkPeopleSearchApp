# VkPeopleSearchApp
A sample Windows 10 Mobile app for updated VkLib library. 

This is my mini-research of VK services (or, how to use VkLib...)

## About
My VkPeopleSearchApp code based on VkLib/VkPeopleSearchApp by Stealth2012. 

## 2 words about the original
- Shows how to use VkLib to perform OAuth and to search users in VK.com.
- A sample Windows Phone 8.1 (WinRT) app for VkLib library is obsolete (it can't connect to vk at now)
